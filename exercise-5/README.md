M18 Exercise 5

For this exercise you will be making an interactive plot in Shiny that allows the user to display different aspects of a dataset.

The data we will be using is from the HSUAR package, and it is called womensrole. A survey was conducted that asked men and women of varying levels of education if they agreed or disagreed with the following statement:

"Women should take care of running their homes and leave running the country up to men."

Documentation can be found here : https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/HSAUR/HSAUR.pdf

The application you build will have two input selectors that allow users to choose whether the data from men, women, or both are displayed on a plot, and whether agree or disagree is displayed.

This assignment will require low level data manipulation, the primary goal is to understand the relationship between the server and ui comopnents of a Shiny application.

To begin, either fork and clone this module or set an upstream and rebase to get this exercise onto your machine. Instructions are included on the server and ui files respectively of what steps you should take to complete the exercise. You should read through both but start with the steps in the ui file.

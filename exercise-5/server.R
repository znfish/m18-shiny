library(shiny)
library(HSAUR)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

#Load the dataset 'womensrole' from the HSUAR package (same way you would load a built in dataset)

#and turn it into an output plot
#Hint: reference the input values using 'input$inputID'

    #Here use your different input values to define what data is used to render your plot
    #The x axis will be the level of education
    #The y axis will be the level of agreement or disagreement
